You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate,
a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a
world of sharks and savages. You've indulged in larceny
on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul
to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers
to you, and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory
reputation in many a port town.
If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy,
you can choose the Bad Reputation feature 
instead of the Ship's Passage feature.
