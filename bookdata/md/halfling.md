The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from
marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation.
So wander, but even they love peace, food, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road
or a raft floating downriver.

The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger
creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding
offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively
harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries
in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and
political strife.
