Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of
them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class,
making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and
con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized
into thieves' guilds or crime families.

A few rogues make an honest living as
locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can
be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats and
were-rats haunt the sewers. As adventurers, rogues fall 
on both sides of the law.

Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes'
vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation.
When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning
over brute strength, placing one precise strike 
exactly where it will hurt the target most. 
Rogues have an almost
supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn
magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.
