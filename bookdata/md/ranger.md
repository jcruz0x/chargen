Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the
hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the
terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of
trackless forests and across wide and empty plains,
rangers keep their unending watch.

Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a
guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend
the outskirts of civilization from lhe ravages of monsters
and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In
some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join
forces with druidic circles. 

Rangers focus their combat training
on techniques that are particularly useful against their
specific favored foes.
Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers
acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's
power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their
combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt.
A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly
focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.
