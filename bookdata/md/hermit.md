You lived in seclusion-either in a sheltered community
such as a monastery, or entirely alone-for a formative
part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of
society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of
the answers you were looking for.

Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion,
whereas others chafe against it and long for company.
Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the
solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are
driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.
