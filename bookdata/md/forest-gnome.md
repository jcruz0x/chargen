As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion
and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of
D&D, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather
in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using illusions
and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or
to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest
gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited
woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as
their most important allies. 

These gnomes also befriend
small forest animais and rely on them for information
about threats that might prowl their lands.
