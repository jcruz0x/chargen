Elves are a magical people of otherworldy grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in
places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light.
Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and other many other races. 
They are slightly shorter and more slender than humans, and can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad
perspective on events.
