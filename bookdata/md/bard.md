The bard is a master of song,
speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say
that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the
words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these
primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout
the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch
and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their
spells and powers.

The greatest strength of bards is their sheer
versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines
in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and
hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable
of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using
their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their
spells lean toward charms and illusions and 
they have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects.

Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and
their natural desire to travel makes an adventuring 
career a natural calling.
