You are a member of an artisan's guild, skilled in
a particular field and closely associated with other
artisans. You are a well-established part of the
mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the
constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your
skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the
sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in
your own right.

Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in
the world-until they set down their tools and take up
an adventuring career. They understand the value of
hard work and the importance of community, but they're
vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.
