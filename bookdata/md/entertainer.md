You thrive in front of an audience. You know how to
entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them.
Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you,
awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your music
raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance
steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever
techniques you use, your art is your life.

Successful entertainers have to be able to capture
and hold an audience's attention, so they tend to
have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They're
inclined toward the romantic and often cling to
high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the
appreciation of beauty.
