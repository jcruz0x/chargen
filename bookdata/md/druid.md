Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or
emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are
an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury.
They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see
themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.

Druids revere nature above al, gaining their spells and
other magical powers either from the force of nature
itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a
mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature
rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others
serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces.
The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called
the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in
temples and shrines.

Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or
watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a
significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance
or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active
role in combating the threat, as adventurers.
