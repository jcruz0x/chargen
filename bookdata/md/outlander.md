You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the
comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the
migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather
more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend,
and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking
creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in
your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a
recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in
places where you don't know the specific features of the
terrain, you know the ways of the wild.

Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized
folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of
life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the
natural world of which they are a part are the most
important bonds to most outlanders.
