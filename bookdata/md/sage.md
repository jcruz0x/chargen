You spent years learning the lore of the multiverse. You
scoured manuscripts, studied scrolls, and listened to the
greatest experts on the subjects that interest you. Your
efforts have made you a master in your fields of study.

Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their
characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to
scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly - 
sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means
toward other ideals.
