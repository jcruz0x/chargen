Orc and human tribes sometimes form
alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror
of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are
sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. 

Some half-orcs
rise to beeome proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human
blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded ore
rivaIs. Some venture into the world to prove their worth
among humans and other more civilized races. Many of
these beeome adventurers, achieving greatness for their
mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs
and savage fury.

Half-orcs' grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads,
jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and lowering builds make
their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand
belween 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between
180 and 250 pounds.

Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and
ornamental scars as things of beauty.
