To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer
violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and
fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. 
Tieflings know that this is because of a
pact struck generations ago -- not
their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which
they will always be held accountable.

Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the
broadest possible sense, they still look human. However,
their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their
appearance. 

Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes. 
They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil
around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their
teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are
solid colors with no visible selera or pupil. 
Their skin tones can sometimes include various
shades of red.

Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in
human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters
of those places, where they often grow up to be 
swindlers or thieves.
