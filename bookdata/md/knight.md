A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most
societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you
wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature 
instead of the Position of Privilege feature.
One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble
who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for
training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two
remaining retainers might include a groom to care for
your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and
even helps you put it on).
As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly
love, you might include among your equipment a banner
or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you
have given your heart-in a chaste sort of devotion.
(This person could be your bond.)
