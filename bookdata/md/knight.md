A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most
societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you
wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature.
One is your squire, aiding you in exchange for
knighthood training. Your remaining retainers might 
care for your horse or polish
your armor and help you put it on.
As an emblem of chivalry, you might include 
among your equipment a banner
or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you
have given your heart-in a chaste sort of devotion.
(This person could be your bond.)
