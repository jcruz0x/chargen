War has been your life for as long as you care to
remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of
weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques,
including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You
might have been part of a standing national army or a
mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local
militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.

The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of
military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping
their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving
them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred..
