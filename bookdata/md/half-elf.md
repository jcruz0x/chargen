Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither,
half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities
of their elf and human parents: human curiosity,
inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined
senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves.
Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their
emotional and physical differences, watching friends
and loved ones age while time barely touches them.
Others live with the elves, growing restless as they
reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while
their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves,
unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary
wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in
the adventuring life.
