You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You
carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects
taxes, and wields political influence. You
might be a pampered aristocrat, a former merchant 
just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel 
with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be
an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply
about the people who live and work on your land.

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle
than most people ever experience, and their personalities
reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a
plethora of bonds-responsibilities to family, to other
nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted
to the family's care, or to the title itself. But this
responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.
