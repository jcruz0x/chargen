Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the
dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets
them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic
gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally
hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining
the best attributes of dragons and humanoids.

Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect
in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. 
The blood of a particular type of dragon runs
very strong through some dragonborn clans. These
dragonborn often boast scales that closely match
those of their dragon ancestor.
