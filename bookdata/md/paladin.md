A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness,
to stand with the good things of the world against the
encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil
wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various
aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are
bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their
sacred work. 

Although many paladins are devoted to
gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a
commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.
Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat,
mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so,
their martial skills are secondary to the magical power
they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite
the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent
and those who join them in the fight for justice.

Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A
delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest
driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of
treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests,
and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the
cosmic balance away from oblivion.
