Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies
hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts
made with mysterious beings of supernatural power,
warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of
beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and
alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together
arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly
being. The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor
but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as
the ability to see in darkness or to read any language)
to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards,
warlocks supplement their magic with some facility
at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light
armor and know how to use simple weapons.

Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge
and power, which compels them into their pacts and
shapes their lives, This thirst drives warlocks into their
pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
