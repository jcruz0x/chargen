You are an experienced criminal with a history of
breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among
other criminals and still have contacts within the
criminal underworld, being far closer than most
to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades
the underbelly of civilization.

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface,
and many of them are villainous to the core. But some
have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming,
characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but
criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.
