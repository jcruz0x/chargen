Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface
world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. They now live in the
depths of the underdark. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished
obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.
