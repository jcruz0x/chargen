You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that
time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the
deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the
bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of
the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand
at something new.

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of
life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life
aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most
important attachments.
