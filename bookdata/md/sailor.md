You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that
time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the
deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the
bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of
the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand
at something new.

Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed
with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship,
a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship?
How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled?
Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost
with all hands?

What were your duties on board - boatswain, captain,
navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the
captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good
terms with your fellows, or on the run?

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of
life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life
aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most
important attachments.
