Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. 
Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh
as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller, and their courage and endurance are easily 
a match for larger folk.

Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals
and forge items of wonder. Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love and can 
live to be more than 400 years old. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a
well ordered society. They tend towards good as well, with a belief in a just order.
