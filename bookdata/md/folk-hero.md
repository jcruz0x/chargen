You come from a humble social rank, but you are
destined for so much more. Already the people of
your home village regard you as their champion, and
your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and
monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere.

A folk hero is one of the common people, for better
or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble
origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home
communities remain very important to them.
