You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family.
They can be attendants or messengers, and one
might be a majordomo. They are commoners who
can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight
for you, will not follow you into dangerous areas
such as dungeons, and will leave if they are frequently
endangered or abused.
