You can always find a place to perform, usually in an
inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or
even in a noble's court. You receive free
lodging and food as
long as you perform each night. Your
performance makes you something of a local figure.
Strangers recognize and like you in a town where you have
performed.
