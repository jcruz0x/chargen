Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people
among the common races. They have widely varying
tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands
where they have settled. When they settle, though,
they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and
great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An
individual human might have a relatively short life span,
but a human nation or culture preserves traditions
with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's
memory.

A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood. revealing hints of 
elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their
late teens and rarely live even a single century.
