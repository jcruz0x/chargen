You have spent your life in the service of a temple. 
You act as an
intermediary between the realm of the holy and the
mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering
sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the
presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a
cleric - performing sacred rites is not the same thing as
channeling divine power.
Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other
quasi-divine being and work with your
DM to detail the nature of your religious service.
Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or
were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call
to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were
the leader of a small cult or an occult group?

Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples
and religious communities. Their study of the
history and tenets of their faith and their relationships
to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their
mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some
hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond
taken to an extreme.
