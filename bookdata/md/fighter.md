Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,
and bandit kings-as fighters, they all share an
unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a
thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they
are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and
staring it defiantly in the face.

Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every
fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a
long-sword or a great-sword, or use a bow. Beyond that
basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a
certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery,
some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some
on augmenting their martial skills with magic. 

Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as
adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and
other dangerous work common among adventurers is
second nature for a fighter, not all that different from
the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks,
perhaps, but also much greater rewards.
