A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines
through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes
average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45
pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned
with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses),
and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their
fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction,
as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in
everything around.

As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a
wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of
enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life.
Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly
puns and pranks, they're just as dedicated to the more
serious tasks they undertake, Many gnomes are skilled
engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors.
