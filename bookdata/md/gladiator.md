A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel
or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat
into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of
flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you
might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor.
Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a
place to perform in any place that features combat for
entertainment-perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret
pit fighting club.
