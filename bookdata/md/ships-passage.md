When you need to, you can secure free passage on
a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring
companions. You might sail on the ship you served on,
or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps
one captained by a former crew-mate). Because you're
calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or
route that will meet your every need - your DM will 
determine how long it takes. In return, you
and your companions are expected to assist the crew
during the voyage.
