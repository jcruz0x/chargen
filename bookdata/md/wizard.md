Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast
spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures
monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the
future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest
spells change one substance into another, call meteors
down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

Wizards' lives are seldom mundane, The closest a
wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working
as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching
others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell
their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or
pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the
most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their
libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and
lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts
in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have
been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets
could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic
available in the present age.
