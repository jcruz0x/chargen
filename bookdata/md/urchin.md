You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor.
You had no one to watch over you or to provide for
you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought
fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other
desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on
rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and
endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or
a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds,
and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some
combination of each.

Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for
good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a
commitment to the people with whom they shared life
on the street or by a burning desire to find a better 
life and maybe get some payback on all the rich 
people who treated them badly.
