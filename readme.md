# Dnd 5e Character Generator

This is a work-in-progress character generator for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons.
Most but not all character options are currently supported, and currently everything 
is client side only, although eventually it will support creating an account and storing 
characters that have been made.

It is usable now though - characters can be created step by step and the convenient
summary at the end makes it easy to copy the resulting character to a character sheet.

The character generator can be accessed at http://chargen.jcruz0x.com

Currently the variant human option that gets a feat
at first level is not supported, and only the 'roll-for-gold' option is available for
equipment purchasing. Eventually I'd like to make the feats and the convenient 
class/background equipment choices available, as well as possibly more races, backgrounds, 
and class options from the various add on books.

This character generator only makes first level characters -- no plans exist to make it
support leveling up a character or making high level or multiclassed characters. (Someday 
I might feel up to creating a redesigned version 2.0 that supports those features, 
with a new UI that would make it practical as a 'character manager' to be used throughout 
a campaign, but don't hold your breath on that.)
